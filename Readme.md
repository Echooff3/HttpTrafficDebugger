# Http Traffic Debugger

Simple express app to listen to all kinds of HTTP Traffic. Similar to [Post Bin](https://postb.in/). 

## Getting Started
* Clone this repo
* npm install
* node index.js

## Tips
I find it helpful to debug this in VS Code. Put a breakpoint on line 14 of index.js then debug. Any request that comes through will be stopped so you can inspect it.
